# Preface
This project is build and maintained by a group of solution architects at Red Hat. It originated from SAs responsible for diverse manufacturing customers in Germany and has grown to include other verticals as well. 

There are also further Manuela-linked projects for GitOps, ArgoCD and some demo apps to be deployed within the demo. 
You can check them out in this Github directory https://github.com/sa-mw-dach .

CAVEAT: Some of the technologies involved are bleeding edge, and so implementation details might change if a better tool is found for a particular purpose.  
## Purpose

## Intended audience
Everyone who needs to showcase IoT Edge use cases for the various verticals. New modules or enhancements to existing ones are always welcome.
## Possible use cases
